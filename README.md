Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project. Be sure to incorporate all the files from our GitHub repo.
If you use Replit, follow these steps to set up the project:

Start by importing the project on Replit.
Next, you will see a .replit window.
Select Use run command and click the Done button.
When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
HINT: You can use the multer npm package to handle file uploading.
